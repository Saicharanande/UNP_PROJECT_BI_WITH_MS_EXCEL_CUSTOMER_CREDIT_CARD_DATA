# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

I worked on a project called UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA with my friends. In this project, we analyzed customer credit card data using Microsoft Excel to generate valuable business insights. I created key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate customer behaviors, such as spending trends and repayment patterns. We used pivot tables to organize and summarize the data dynamically and created pivot charts to visualize the trends and insights effectively.
